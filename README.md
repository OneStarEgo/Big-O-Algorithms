# Big O & Algorithms Lab

This lab presents a few problems that require algorithms to solve.

# Tech Stack
This lab is implemented in Python

# Problems
Task 1: Even or Odd

Given a numeric value, determine if it is even or odd. The function should take the value as a parameter and return a boolean value (True if even, False if odd).

Leave a comment above the function stating the time complexity.

Task 2: Less than 100

Given a list of numbers, determine if each item in the list is lower than 100. The function should take in the list as a parameter and return a boolean value (False if there are any numbers greater than or equal to 100, True if all numbers are less than 100).

Task 3: Repeated Names

Given a list of names, determine if any names are contained in the list more than once. The function should take in the list as a parameter and return a boolean value (True if there are any repeated names, False if there are no repeats).

Task 4: Sort List

Given a list of numbers, manually sort the list into ascending order (may not use built-in `.sort()` method).
